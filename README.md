## Flash matching validation studies

Evaluation of the performance of the flash matching algorithm on single particle datasets. The reference particle will
be a single muon in the center (x,y,z) = (-100,0,0) center of TPC 0 with pz = 1 GeV/c. The following tests will be performed:

- Angle -> Vary the angle of the particle with respect to the yz and xz planes
- Energy -> Vary the energy of the particle
- Position -> Vary the position of the particle in the TPC. For this test the particle will travel with py = -1 GeV/c
- Particle -> Vary the particle type
